           Michael: A dark background color scheme with (mostly) matte colors 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"michael" is a dark background based color scheme with muted, less intense colors. The background color has been shamelessly copied from the "inkpot" color scheme. Everything else has been customized.


Installation
-------------
To install, copy to ~/.vim/colors directory.
After installation, enable it with :colorscheme michael

This scheme is currently meant to work with GVim only. Further versions will enable support for terminals.
